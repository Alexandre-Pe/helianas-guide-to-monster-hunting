The first is to grow a single new medusozoa over a single moon’s cycle and then birth this inch-long, instinct-driven youngster into the waters surrounding its home The second is to secrete a calcareous exoskeleton, fusing their body with the reef and growing the cnidarans’ coral home.",

During this juvenile stage, a time known as the uko’ulush (the ‘wild time’), a medusozoa is largely ignored by other cnidarans, who believe that “trial by ocean makes the hardest pearls.” Once a cnidaran completes this juvenile stage, it is brought into the reef, a utilitarian and communal space where the customs, culture, and values of that reef are passed on, the uko’malang (the ‘time of waiting’)."

Individuals that start on the uko’fa do so for a multitude of reasons Some seek to bring back treasures from the world beyond and enhance their own community Others feel a need to disperse, finding other reefs to join or even forming new reefs with like-minded medusozoa met on their travels A very few become enraptured by wanderlust and spend the rest of their days among winding ocean currents, delving into damp dungeons, and cavorting in ports with other seadogs."
